"""
Centralized, labeled pipeline settings for ARCxSpeech.

Phase 0 / Change 2:
    Every hardcoded analysis number that was scattered across
    app/preprocessing.py and app/feature_extractor.py -- filter
    cutoffs, the shared silence/voicing-detection numbers used by
    both the Speech Rate (syllable nuclei) and DDK repetition
    detectors, etc. -- now lives in one place, PipelineSettings,
    instead of as bare constants or inline literals.

    This is a labeling/organization change only. The default
    PipelineSettings() below reproduces the exact previous hardcoded
    values (the filter cutoffs are pulled straight from app/config.py,
    unchanged), so nothing about analysis behavior changes unless code
    explicitly constructs a PipelineSettings with different values.

Phase 0 / Change 3:
    Each of the four preprocessing steps -- DC offset removal,
    high-pass filter, low-pass filter, notch filter -- can now be
    independently switched off via the enable_* flags below. There is
    no frontend toggle for this yet; these flags simply default to
    True, which reproduces the previous "always run all steps"
    behavior exactly.
