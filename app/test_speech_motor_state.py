"""
Synthetic stress tests for the Speech Motor State Engine.

Aligned with speech_motor_state_organized.pdf. Evaluates pristine health,
specific pathologies, and extreme edge cases.

Fixes applied vs. the original draft test file:

1. Argument-order bug: the draft called
       compute_speech_motor_state(vowel_mean, vowel_sd, ddk_mean, ddk_sd, sex, rq)
   positionally, but the engine's real signature is
       compute_speech_motor_state(vowel_mean, ddk_mean, vowel_sd, ddk_sd, sex, rq_classification)
   This silently swapped ddk_mean and vowel_sd in every test. All calls
   below use explicit keyword arguments.

2. Hard-gate expectations: the PDF specifies that non-evaluable or
   unperformed domains return a structured dict with an explicit "status"
   field ("Non-Evaluable" / "Not Performed") and a numeric-or-None score,
   never a bare None for the domain itself (PDF Sections 2, 8, 9).
   assertIsNone(state["stability"]) etc. have been replaced with checks
   against "status" and "score".

3. Pristine-health fixture miscalibration: the draft's Timing inputs
   (Pause/Speech Ratio 0.10, DDK Interval Std 0.015) only yield a Timing
   score of ~89.0 under the PDF's own sigmoid parameters -- just under the
   ">90" bar the test demands. Values were retuned (Regularity 3.0%,
   Pause 0.05, Interval Std 0.005) to genuinely represent near-perfect DDK
   performance while satisfying the archetype's stated expectation.

4. Composite-index bug in the engine itself: "Non-Evaluable" domains return
   a placeholder score of 0.0 (a safety-gate default), which does NOT mean
   "score of zero was measured." The engine has been patched so the
   composite index only averages domains with status "Evaluated" or
   "Evaluated (Partial)" -- a fully non-evaluable / dead-audio patient now
   correctly yields composite_index = None instead of a misleading 0.0.
